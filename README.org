* Introduction

  This software is a simple utility for testing a serial port.  It
  reads from the standard input and writes to a serial port.  Often I
  wondered why no one ever published such a tool before.  I myself have
  need such a thing when developing embedded systems.  Anyhow, here it
  is now, for you to enjoy.
